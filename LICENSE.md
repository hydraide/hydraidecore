# HydrAIDE Core – License Overview (Human‑Friendly)

HydrAIDE Core is the powerful engine behind our search, segmentation, and data communication infrastructure.  
It was built from scratch to serve real-world use cases, with a focus on performance, clarity, and scale.

We want to make it **accessible to real developers and internal product teams**,  
while protecting it from being turned into just another faceless SaaS clone.

---

## 🛡️ Why the Core uses SSPL with commercial restrictions

Unlike the SDK (which is LGPL and open for nearly all use), the **Core is licensed under SSPL v1**,  
with **custom rules** to prevent commercial exploitation without permission.

This allows you to use it **freely in internal, embedded, or productized ways**,  
but restricts you from **reselling it or offering it as a hosted/public service**.

---

## 🔍 What you can do for free (no license needed)

You are totally fine using HydrAIDE Core if:

- You deploy it internally as part of your own stack
- You embed it into a product where **the Core is not publicly exposed**
- You use it to power **private or internal features** (e.g. search, segmentation, data orchestration)
- You're building something where HydrAIDE **supports** the system, but is not **the main product**

✅ Even in commercial settings, **you don’t need a paid license**,  
as long as you’re not exposing HydrAIDE itself as the core value or service.

## 🚫 When you need a commercial license

You must **reach out for a license** if:

- You offer **HydrAIDE Core’s functionality as a hosted service** (e.g. search-as-a-service, segmentation API, embedded AI engine, etc.)
- You create a product where HydrAIDE **is the core selling point**
- You rebrand or white-label HydrAIDE under your own name
- You offer it as a platform, plugin, or engine for third-party customers to interact with directly

👉 In short: if **your business model relies on HydrAIDE Core being externally consumed**,  
you need to contact us for a commercial agreement.

## 🧠 Philosophy behind the license

We believe in a fair, values-first ecosystem.

- Keep it open for builders and teams who want real tools
- Prevent parasitic SaaS repackaging or white-label cloning
- Ensure long-term sustainability and quality for our developer community

This license model supports that.
